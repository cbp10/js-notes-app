# js-notes-app

This is a frontend, single page web app, written in javascript. The app was created using the TDD approach without a testing library.

The basic domain model is as follows:

```
Note Controller ------ Note List Model ----- Note Model

      |
      |
      | Create view
      |
      |
      
Note List View
```

The project still needs to be refactored to utilise the Single Note View, and to separate responsibilites in the Note Controller.


### Using the application

Open the index.html file in the project root
```
$ open index.html
```

### Running tests

Open the test.html file in the project root
```
$ open test.html
```
